# MatlabToolbox
All Matlab functions reorganized into separate folders

MatlabiRobotCreate - Functions to control the Create and get sensor data from the Create. Based on Joel Esposito's Matlab Toolbox for the iRobot Create.

MatlabCreateRaspPiRealSense - Functions to connect and communicate with the Raspberry Pi, the Intel RealSense camera, And the Optitrack overhead localization system.

MatlabCreateRaspPiRealSenseDebug - Functions to connect and communicate with the Raspberry Pi and the Intel RealSense camera in Debug mode. All communications through one tcp/ip port, and long time delays. 

MatlabRaspPiUpdate - Functions used to update the Raspberry Pi on the Create. Not used in the lab and do not have to be on the lab computers or in the path. Use with caution!

All the MatlabToolbox needs to be in the path.
